# BM25 Job Text Search
This project uses BM25 ranking to enable keyword-based relevance search over
job postings. BM25 is a classic information retrieval algorithm that is 
particularly effective for **keyword matching** in large text corpora.

## Why Text Search for Job Postings?
Job postings contain largely unstructured text:
- Job titles
- Description
- Requirements
- Responsibilities

Exact key matches are often important (e.g., "Python" or "SQL"), but simple
counting may overvalue kong documents. BM25 provides a way to score relevance
while accounting for document length and term frequency saturation.

## BM25 (Mest Matching 25)
BM25 ranks documents based on a probabilistic retrieval model.

Key ideas:
- Term Frequency (TF)  
  More occurrences of a term in a document increases its score, but with
  **diminishing returns**.
- Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)  
  Rare terms across the corpus are weighted more heavily.
- Document Length Normalization  
  Longer Douments are penalized slightly to avoid overestimating relevance.

### BM25 formula intuition

The BM25 score for a document `D` given a query `Q` is:

    score(D, Q) = Σ over t in Q [
        IDF(t) * ( f(t, D) * (k + 1) )
        ---------------------------------
        f(t, D) + k * (1 - b + b * |D| / avgdl)

    ]


Where:

- `f(t, D)` = frequency of term `t` in document `D`
- `|D|` = length of document `D`
- `avgdl` = average document length across the corpus
- `k` and `b` = hyperparameters controlling term saturation and document length normalization


| Feature         | TF-IDF                          | BM25                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Term weighting  | Linear (TF × IDF)               | Saturating, probabilistic |
| Document length | Not normalized                  | Penalized automatically   |
| Retrieval focus | Semantic similarity via vectors | Keyword relevance ranking |
